## A little bit about me

What concerns my **knoledges** in IT-development - they are **about zero level.**
I liked programming at school and university. That time Turbo Pascal & Assembler were popular. 
But after graduating... difficult times, 1990-s, maybe you understand me))

Several days ago I heard from one my friend about your nice school and I decided to try it.
Now I'm interesting to make some devices at arduino platform. And later maybe - to operate them by smartphone. 
So I think that now this studying is more for me & my hobbies, than for finding a job. But ...

And I think, that it will be more difficult for me, than for others. Because I have no modern basic concepts in my mind.
**Example:** 
> I'm listening your lection about Android Studio - 
> and I'm looking for concepts ABD, SDK, IDE etc... )))

And I don't have much time now)  
**But I'll try to study - and I'll do it!**


**Thank you for your school !!!**

Sergey
